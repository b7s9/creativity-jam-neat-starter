## Fruc. 10

10th of Thermidor- 

This morning, someone by the name of “Roa” showed up in town today. All they had on them was a mask and a holocase, using the damn thing to project some kind of mech. She calls it the “Y33 H4W”, claiming it might be an “ace in the hole” for us winning the hoedown. When I asked her what her intentions and loyalties were, I couldn’t help but feel like she kept telling me what I wanted to hear, and that just doesn’t sit right with me. But.
I don't want to be a yellow belly and waste this opportunity. It may be the only way for us to come out of this mess on top.
