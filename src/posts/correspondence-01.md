**Dear Mr. Wranjer,**

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I need to inform you of grave and tragic news. After the latest Invasion, The mine is completely dry. I am not exaggerating. The Shift Mngr toured all 10 levels once it was deemed safe. All gold which was undergoing processing is gone. All currently known mineral deposits are gone. We were also given charge of a surplus of processed gold that was taken under our charge the day prior, this was all lost as well during the invasion. 

The timing of Faetherwatchâ€™s transportation error and this larceny is rather suspicious. Hopefully it is nothing more than a simple coincidence. Obviously This will require further investigation. Your leadership is required at this time, we hope to see you here at the mine forthwith.

Best, 

Sh1ne.

**Dear Nephew,**

1 day travel,

Best, 

Sl33k
