Dear Sl33k,

The events of the recent days have been, to be understating, not ideal. The treasury is not at an acceptable level. I’d like to think I have been understanding of previous invasions from these nanobots but your new levels of incompetence has reached a new and I dare I say impressive level. Your attempt to provide security is nothing more than a lick and promise. So much so that I can’t help but think this is all a part of something bigger. Do you take me for a sack of rocks my good sir? Sl33k, you couldn’t pour water out of a boot even if the instructions were written on the heel. It is all clear now. You are keeping that gold all for yourself. Not very clever of you if I do say so myself.

The full scope of your sins will be accounted for,
