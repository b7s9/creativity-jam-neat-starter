## Fruc. 11

I know it is important to see the comedy of things but I'm more stressed than a jackrabbit in a fox den. The city funds are growing lower now that the source has been depleted. The search for a new source has been made harder due to the Wranjer treasonous scrunge. Construction on Roa’s Boyhowdee was completed yesterday and final preparations are being made. My my what an ungly thing that is. My people talk of strange blooms of smoke that seem to be coming from the direction of the mine. Through the looking glass I spotted a giant goliath made of steel out in the plains. I have so many questions.
