![Sleek's contract with Roa](/static/img/sleek-roa-contract.jpg)

Hi Roa,

Here are the requested funds. Your help in saving this town from the greedy Faetherwatches will not go unseen.

I cannot wait to see the fear in the tradersâ€™ eyes. I wish you could be there too but I understand success in your line of work comes at the cost of availability.

Also I mean this with the greatest respect but I have seen lame horses with better penmanship than you. I have the address for a great teacher here in town if you ever so desire to better yourself

Thank you & Take Care,
