Roa,

I hope I am getting the address correctly. I was having trouble reading it. 

Enclosed is the agreed upon payment for the designs. I am eagerly awaiting them so we can get started on construction. You have no idea what the Wranjers have done to this town. Their inability to secure the mine has led to the downfall of this town. Not only that but they think they can get away with taking the wealth for themselves. It is absolutely astounding the levels of depravity these dirt-covered jackasses are able to descend to.

I apologize I’ve been getting quite worked up lately. Anyways I appreciate you willing to come help out despite being an outsider to these parts. You’ll always be welcome around here.

Best,
