Dear Rhodon, 

You are a coward and a scheister. I will step on your neck with a smile when this is all done and you will still thank me for showing you kindness. Funny of you to accuse me of incompetence when you wouldnâ€™t know a competent action if it introduced itself to you. You and your accusations will not know pain like what I will deliver onto you.

Good Luck,
