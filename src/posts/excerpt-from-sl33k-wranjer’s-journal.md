## 12th of Fructidor- 

Zoren told me today that she detected a signal towards the direction of the mountains through her EM transmitter. I ran towards the observation deck as fast as I could and… I saw it. A massive clockwork beast flying through the air, leaving a trail of steam in its wake. Most of the Wranjers think it’s another plague, coming from the same source as those god-forsaken caedas, but not me, no sir. I think those Faetherwatch bastards got their own ace up their sleeve, it resembles their tech just a little too much. I don’t believe this to be a mere coincidence neither, so the question is: Who’s the snake in the grass?
