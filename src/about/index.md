## About this project

*Spacious Cowgirl Fantasy* was the result of a single-weekend Creativity Jam for a small team of the [2.0 Podcast Community](https://2pointohpodcast.com/). Our community-suggested, randomly selected creative constraints were "western", "sci fi", and "steampunk". Somehow we made it all work!

We had an absolute blast the whole weekend writing a story about betrayal and love, creating time-worn illustrations of our heros and their environment, writing cute and mysterious songs, and hacking together this website to show off our hard work.
